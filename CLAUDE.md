# Whatnow — Project Guide

## What is this?
Whatnow is a task management app for people with ADHD and task paralysis. Users swipe through tasks one at a time instead of staring at an overwhelming list. Built with Flutter, backed by Supabase.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Flutter (Dart), Riverpod state management, GoRouter navigation
- **Backend:** Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Edge Functions)
- **Payments:** Currently Stripe (test mode) — evaluating RevenueCat for IAP
- **Analytics:** TBD (evaluating PostHog)
- **Local DB:** Drift (offline support)
- **Ads:** Google AdMob (test IDs currently)

## Architecture
- `lib/models/` — Data models (Task, Profile, Group)
- `lib/providers/` — Riverpod providers (state management)
- `lib/screens/` — Screen widgets organised by feature
- `lib/widgets/` — Reusable widgets
- `lib/config/` — Theme, environment, ranks, ad config
- `lib/data/` — Drift database for offline cache
- `lib/router/` — GoRouter configuration
- `supabase/functions/` — Edge Functions (stripe-webhook)
- `store/` — Store listing copy and privacy policy

## Brand
- **Name:** Whatnow
- **Domain:** whattasknow.com
- **Colour:** Purple #6750A4
- **Tagline:** "Stop overthinking. Start doing."
- **Bundle ID:** com.whatnow.app
- **IMPORTANT:** The swipe feature is called **"What Now?"** — never "What Next?". All UI text, class names, file names, and references must use "What Now?" / `WhatNow`.

## Working Process
1. **Research first** — Every strategic decision gets researched with pros/cons before any code is written
2. **Discuss and align** — Present options to the user, get explicit agreement
3. **Implement** — Only after alignment, write code
4. **Verify** — Run `flutter analyze && flutter build apk --debug` after changes
5. **Update CLAUDE.md** — As decisions are made, document them here for future sessions

## Deep Research Findings (2026-03-15)

### Market Intelligence
- **Tiimo** (iPhone App of the Year 2025): visual timeline, AI co-planner, mood tracking — sets the bar for ADHD apps
- **Finch**: micro-goals + compassionate mechanics (no punishing streaks) — models emotional design
- **ADHD users have 40% higher app abandonment rates** — onboarding and first-session experience are make-or-break
- **Hard paywalls outperform soft freemium** (78% vs 45% trial starts) — current 20-task soft limit may underperform
- **Social features boost retention 40%**, engagement 35%, revenue 2.8x — groups feature is an asset
- **Streaks + milestones reduce 30-day churn by 35%** — gamification is essential, not optional
- **Simple single-tier pricing** reduces choice paralysis for ADHD users

### Design Trends (2025-2026)
- Glassmorphism / liquid glass effects
- Earthy/refined green palettes (shifting away from pure purple)
- Gesture-first navigation (swipe-heavy — aligns well with Whatnow's swipe UX)
- Skeleton/shimmer loading screens (not spinners)
- Micro-animations and haptic feedback for dopamine hits

### Current App Gaps (by severity)

**CRITICAL — blocks store acceptance or causes crashes**
1. Zero widget/integration tests — store reviewers may reject; no regression safety net
2. No App Tracking Transparency (ATT) — iOS will reject with AdMob
3. No GDPR consent flow — legal requirement for UK/EU users
4. No crash reporting — flying blind in production

**HIGH — significantly hurts retention/conversion**
5. No onboarding flow at all — users land in empty task list
6. No notification/reminder system — ADHD users need external prompts
7. No haptic feedback or micro-animations — missing dopamine reinforcement
8. Timer progress lost on app kill — frustrating for core feature
9. No skeleton/shimmer loading screens — feels broken on slow connections
10. All strings hardcoded — no localisation possible
11. No accessibility (font scaling, screen readers, contrast ratios)

**MEDIUM — expected for quality apps**
12. No deep linking / universal links
13. No pagination (task list will degrade with many tasks)
14. No autofocus on form fields
15. No page transition animations
16. No force-update mechanism for breaking changes
17. No feature flags for gradual rollout

### Store Keywords & ASO
- **Primary (high intent):** ADHD planner, ADHD task manager, task paralysis, executive function, focus timer
- **Secondary (broader reach):** to do list ADHD, daily planner, simple task manager, one task at a time, mindful productivity
- **Long-tail (low competition):** task overwhelm help, ADHD friendly app, neurodivergent planner, decision fatigue app
- **Avoid:** "productivity" (saturated), "todo list" (dominated by Todoist/TickTick), "habit tracker" (different category)
- Apple keyword field (100 chars): `ADHD,planner,task paralysis,focus,timer,executive function,neurodivergent,simple,one task`
- Google Play: include "ADHD" and "task" in title + short description
- **Apple subtitle** (30 chars): "ADHD-Friendly Task Manager"

### Streak & Widget Concepts

**Compassionate streak mechanics (Finch-style):**
- Daily streak: complete ≥1 task to maintain
- Compassionate miss handling: "You missed yesterday — that's okay! Your streak is paused, not lost."
- Freeze days: 2 free/month (premium gets unlimited)
- Milestones: 7/30/100/365-day badges with celebration animations
- Weekly summary: Sunday evening notification with task count and top category

**Home screen widgets (`home_widget` package):**
- "Next Task" widget — shows next recommended task with tap-to-complete
- "Daily Streak" widget — flame icon + streak count
- "Progress Ring" widget — circular progress for daily goal
- Start with small (2×2) "Next Task" widget

### Event Driven Groups (v2 Feature Concept)
Evolve existing groups into collaborative task management for events, households, teams, friend groups.
- **Core mechanics:** group task pool, task claiming ("I'll do this"), admin assignment, real-time status visibility
- **Status flow:** Unclaimed → Claimed/Assigned → In Progress → Done
- **Use cases:** party planning, household chores, team projects, ADHD accountability partners
- **Technical scope:** new Supabase tables (group_tasks, group_members with roles), RLS, realtime subscriptions, invite system with deep links, push notifications
- _Major feature — separate design phase required before implementation_

### Price Localisation
- Set GBP base price, use Apple/Google automatic localisation, manually review top 10 markets
- Key markets: UK (home), US (largest English market), EU (GDPR territory), India/Brazil/SEA (high growth, low price sensitivity)
- RevenueCat handles per-country pricing natively via App Store / Play Store price tiers

## App Launch Checklist (Strategic Phase)

### Testing & Quality (build confidence first)
- [ ] Widget tests for core flows (add/edit/complete task, swipe card)
- [ ] Integration tests with Patrol
- [ ] Sentry crash reporting
- [ ] CI/CD with GitHub Actions (analyze, test, build on every PR)

## Key Decisions Log
_Update this section as decisions are made_

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2026-03-15 | Supabase for backend | Already in use, good free tier, auth + DB + edge functions |
| 2026-03-15 | Stripe test mode set up | May be replaced by RevenueCat — Apple requires IAP for digital goods |
| 2026-03-15 | 20-task free limit | Needs validation — discuss in paywall strategy |

### Research-Backed Recommendations (2026-03-15)

| Finding | Recommendation | Rationale |
|---------|---------------|-----------|
| Hard paywall > soft freemium | Consider 7-day free trial → paywall | 78% vs 45% trial starts; ADHD users need to experience value before deciding |
| ADHD 40% higher abandonment | Prioritise onboarding above all else | First session must deliver a "wow" moment within 60 seconds |
| Streaks reduce churn 35% | Add streak system before launch | Non-punishing (Finch-style) — compassionate messaging on missed days |
| Social features 2.8x revenue | Leverage existing groups feature in marketing | Already built; highlight in store screenshots and onboarding |
| Sentry is industry standard | Use Sentry over Firebase Crashlytics | Better Dart support, source maps, breadcrumb trails, generous free tier |
| PostHog recommended | PostHog for analytics + feature flags + A/B | Single platform, open source, GDPR-friendly, replaces multiple tools |
